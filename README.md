# Excel Visual Basic for Applications Pharmacy Functions Library
## Purpose and Features
Custom pharmacy functions enabling a user to calculate patient metrics, lab values, and drug dosing. With the Pharmacy Function Library, you can perform commonly used clinical pharmacy calculations. See a full list of the functions below.


If you are using this for clinical practice, please make sure you are using the correct units (metric vs US). All functions have been tested against multiple online calculators and hand calculations. Please use the functions at your own risk.


Documentation on all functions is located on the [wiki](https://github.com/EszopiCoder/excel-rx-fx-library/wiki) in this repository.
