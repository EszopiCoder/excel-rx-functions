Excel Visual Basic for Applications Pharmacy Functions

Code library for custom pharmacy functions in Excel. Will eventually compile into an Excel add-in. If you are using this for clinical practice, please make sure you are using the correct units (metric vs US). All functions have been tested against multiple online calculators and hand calculations. Please use the functions at your own risk.

If you have any questions or find any bugs, please contact EszopiCoder at pharm.coder@gmail.com
